# VoxelSculpt_Git
 Voxel based sculpting in VR, coded in Unity with C#.
 
 Features I would like to add:
 - Variety of different brushes with a preview of what the brush looks like
 - Different colors / textures for your brush
 - Mirror mode where your brush will be mirrored with a plane
 - Selection - the ability to select a region and transform it
 - Ability to save and load models from a library
 
 Extra features to take the project to another level:
 - Implement own rendering engine - use path / ray tracing and voxel - based optimizations
